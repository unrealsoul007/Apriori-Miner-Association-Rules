Apriori-Miner-Association-Rules
===============================

For this project we will extract association rules from an interesting data set of your choice.  Therefore, project will consist of two main components:  (1) defining your data set of choice  (2) implementing the a-priori algorithm for finding association rules. We can access the data sets at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?limitTo=datasets. There is a wide variety of data sets, and an important part of this project is that you explore these data sets and pick one or more for use in the project.
